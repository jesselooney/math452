Clearly, $A^(-1) = A$. Also, $A$ is clearly differentiable (so $A^(-1) = A$ is too). Therefore, $A$ is a diffeomorphism.

Yes. Consider the extension of $pi$ to all of $RR^3$, $pi': RR^3 -> RR^2$ given by $(x,y,z) |-> (x,y,0)$. Being a projection, $pi'$ is linear, and thus differentiable on $RR^3$. As noted in Example 1, since $pi$ is just the restriction of a differentiable function $pi'$ to $S$, $pi$ is differentiable on $S$.
